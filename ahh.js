You have been encouraging me and the type of work I have been doing these years and I can‚Äôt express how grateful I am‚Äî it feels like you are almost a mentor to me. It really helped alot because I am not confident in my skill sets and I‚Äôve always feel like I am doing poorly in class because of that. I really appreciate it and I am sorry being the one who always turn in things late lol. I was able to get out of my comfort zone and actually going to events like GDC. Can‚Äôt express how thankful I am, I really hope things go smoothly for you and your family!!! ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
